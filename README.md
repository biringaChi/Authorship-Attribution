## Text_Mining-Author_Prediction

Authorship prediction refers to the association of an author to a specific document. In literature, it is very important to know about historical text who wrote it and when it was written. However, we can also predict the nationality of the author, characteristic styles of the author, characteristic styles of the author and genre of the text.


Here, I explore the problem of Authorship Prediction using Text Mining and Sentiment Analysis. This analysis predicts the authors based on a collection of text derived from their authored books. We have performed experiments on books that are extracted from Victorian Era Authors datasets by using different features such as bag of words, n-grams or TF-IDF models. Also implemented different classifier techniques to improve the success rates. The techniques discussed in this project is a two stage process, where in the first stage, text mining and sentiment analysis are performed and in the second stage different classification models are trained to predict the authors.
